# ECE 594Q - Special Topics in Image Synthesis

This repository includes solutions to the assigments given in the ECE 594Q course at UCSB Winter 2014.

## Assignment 1 - Reyes style architecture

The first assigment (tag: Assignment1-Reyes) contains a simple Rendrer with a Reyes style architecture.
It can render Cylinders, Cones and Spheres in 3D space with a couple of shaders, namely texture, color and
displacement.

## Assignment 2 - RayTracer

The second assignment (tag: Assignemnt2-BasicRayTracer) is a whole new rendrer based on a technique called ray tracing.
The rendrer supports shadows, refletions and to a limited degree refractions.
